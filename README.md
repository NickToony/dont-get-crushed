A fast paced platformer with a single goal: **don't get crushed**. How hard can it be?

This game was made in a couple of days for the  [Minimalistic Game Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/minimalistic-jam-3). The jam limited the colours to 10, and discourages any blending/alpha effects. Hence the very simple aesthetic!

## Controls

-   Move: WASD or Arrow keys
-   Jump: Space
-   P: Pause
-   M: Toggle music
-   R: Restart

## Credits

-   Game art and development by myself, **NickToony**
-   Sound effects from **KenneyNL** assets
-   Music: **The Pirate And The Dancer** by **[Rolemusi](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Rolemusic/)**
-   Built in **GameMaker Studio 2**

**WARNING:**  Firefox seems to stutter with this game. Use Chrome, Edge or Safari for best experience.

## Notes

The master branch includes a bunch of refactoring and minor visual improvements, but the jam branch has the version that is available on itch.io.
